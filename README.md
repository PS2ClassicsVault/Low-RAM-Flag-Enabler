# WARNING:
- This module can bootloop you if your system doesn't suuport the low ram flag natively, We highly recommend you to install a Anti Bootloop magisk module to rescue you from this situation, We believe this flag is not supported on Arm64-v8a devices but is know to work on armeabi-v7a devices
